<center> <h1>Gatsby Starter</h1> </center>

This starter is build on top of a feature rich gatsby-theme ([gatsby-theme-tfs](https://github.com/tiagofsanchez/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-tfs)) and you under the hood you will find: 
- MD and MDX 
- Light Mode / Dark Mode 
- Nice Typography (IBM Typography)
- Tags and Categories support
- Code highlighting with [prism-react-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prism-react-renderer)
- React live support with [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live)
- SEO (Sitemap, OpenGraph tags)
- Sound on a couple of buttons with [use-sound](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/use-sound)
- A dashboard with your writing stats

And many more goodies that I will keep adding to the theme as I add new features and functionality.
